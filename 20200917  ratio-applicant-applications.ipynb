The applicants are filtered on the basis of their application submission; once or several times. It was also checked whether the submitted applications have the same titles. The analysis is made of both rounds together and then each round separately. The analysis focuses on three points of attention: applicants, applications, and rounds. The numbers are calculated as a summary of the applications with the same titles that the unique applicants have submitted. Subsequently, an analysis was made in terms of applicant-application ratio, i.e. applicants who submitted the same application (i.e. with the same title) two or more times in the multiple rounds or in a single round."
